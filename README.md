# B.Tech 2018 - Final Year Project

Final Year Project for B.Tech: IT. This project builds a machine learning model to identify the probability of a neighbourhood becoming gentrified.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* [Machine Learning Server 9.30](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/machine-learning-server/install/machine-learning-server-windows-install) - Installs R for Windows
* [poLCA](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v042i10) - R Package for LCA

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

* You are required to register for a Microsoft account and activate VSS essentials platform.
* Download the Machine Learning Server package from the VSS essentials platform for free.

## Deployment

* Run the script in RGui or another R client
* Deployment of the learning model to a web service is described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/machine-learning-server/operationalize/how-to-deploy-web-service-publish-manage-in-r).

## Built With

* [Machine Learning Server 9.30](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/machine-learning-server/install/machine-learning-server-windows-install)- The machine learning framework used
* [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.8.html) - text editor used
* [RGui](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) - R for Windows
